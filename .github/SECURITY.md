# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away.

Please do not use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ittuann/qingshanasd/issues) to report security issues in open source projects, as this will make the problem visible to everyone, including malicious actors.
